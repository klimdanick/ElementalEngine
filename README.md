# ElementalEngine V4!
Welcome to ElementalEngine! a lightweight and extensible Java game engine designed for creating 2D games with ease.

This engine is designed with the goal of making game development about programming again. A lot of modern engines use a lot of UI to create a game, To us this takes away the creative freedom of a programmer.
Whenever you look at a game made with unity, you instantly know it is made with unity becouse al unity games feel the same. And you certainly can make verry creative, unique and interesting games with unity or other modern engines, it is a lot harder then it should be. And that is why this engine is made, not to be the best 3D render engine out there, or to be used by anyone, no this engine is for peaple who want to make a game that feels like old retro games that ware made with programming magic, becouse in our eyes that is what makes a game special. But is also a great way to learn about game development, from a programmers perspective of course. you can use it to make fun games while you are learning object orientated programming with a modern "easy to use" language.
